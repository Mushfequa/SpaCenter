# Translations (English)

	This is the default translations file, which is in the English language.
	
	* There are numerous rules to adhere to when using this file
	* One reason is to be able to use convention over configuration
	* Please read through this whole comment and understand how to use it


## Items in the object

	For a field:
		. create a key pointing to an object
		. name the key [field name]Field
		. Add label, placeholder and help
		. Add labelAfter for checkboxes

		For example:

		moneyField: {
			label: "Money",
			placeholder: "dollars",
			help: "Give us all your money please!"
		}

		Example 2:

		extraField: {
			label: "Extra options",
			labelAfter: "Yes, I'd like extra options"
		}

		The above will render a checkbox with a label "Extra options", 
		and the labelAfter immediately following the checkbox


	For a field with options or a list of fields with options
		. create a key pointing to an object
		. name the key [field name]Field_[id]
		. Add label, labelAfter, placeholder or anything else useful

		For example:

		spamField: {
			label: "Spam me",
			help: "We'd like to keep you informed"
		},

		spamField_spamTrue: {
			labelAfter: "Yes please send me spam!"
		},
		
		spamField_spamFalse: {
			labelAfter: "No thanks, I prefer to not get spam"
		},

		The radioBox set for spam has a list of two options:
		true and false, and this will set labels for each.

	For a list of text:
		. Create a key pointing to a list of strings
		. name the key [name]List

		For example:

		benefitsList: [
			"Receive 10 % off your first order",
			"Start as soon as you have been verified",
			"We handle everything, you just wait for orders!"
		]


	For a heading:
		. Create a key pointing to a string
		. name the key [name]Heading

		For example:

		signupHeading: "Sign up"


	For a URL:
		. Create a key pointing to a string
		. name the key [name]Url

		For example:

		homeUrl: "/"


	For general text:
		. Create a key pointing to a string
		. name the key [name]Text

		For example:

		signupDescriptionText: "Sign up today, as there are many benefits"


## Comments for items, so we know what they are for

	Be sure to add a comment string to each item
		. Create a key pointing to a list of strings
		. name the key [name]_Comment

		For example:

		moneyField_Comment: "Used on the signup form"
